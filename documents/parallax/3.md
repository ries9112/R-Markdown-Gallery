# Why create a parallax scroll document?

A **parallax scroll document** allows you to show visualizations, GIFs, and images alongside text. This is great for creating professional, sleek-looking static pages for you to present an essay, an argument, a concept, or even some lyrics or poems that you've written. 

This isn't necessarily a ground breaking invention, but generating a document like this with Markdown files and R is just very cool, and easy to implement.
