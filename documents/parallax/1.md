# Generating a parallax scroll document in R

This example will walk you through on how to generate a **parallax scroll document** in R, using the package **parallaxr**.

You may find random GIFs on this example, but you can be assured that you can replace these with more sensible options of your own choice when you come to use the package. 

Visit [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/martinctc/parallaxr) for the code. This is built as an R package, which allows you to easily reproduce the scroll document.
