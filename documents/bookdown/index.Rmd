# Overview

This document has code embedded throughout. In the next section we will create a visualization using the already loaded dataset `eth_data`:
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
datatable(eth_data)
```

The table above uses the **`DT`** package [@R-DT]. The **`bookdown`** package [@R-bookdown] is packed with functionality, including in-text citations that automatically generate the references as we have done here.
